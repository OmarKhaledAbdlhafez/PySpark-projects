## ML Project using PySpark: Flights Dataset
This project demonstrates various machine learning techniques implemented using PySpark on the flights dataset. The dataset contains information about flights, and we will explore regression, classification, ensemble methods, and evaluation techniques.

### Dataset
The flights dataset is a collection of records containing information about flights. It includes features such as the flight carrier,, org, mile, depart, duration,delay, and more. The dataset is stored in a CSV file named flights.csv.
