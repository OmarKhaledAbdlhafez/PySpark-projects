## ML Project using PySpark: Flights Dataset
This project demonstrates various machine learning techniques implemented using PySpark on the flights dataset. The dataset contains information about flights, and we will explore regression, classification, ensemble methods, and evaluation techniques.
Spark is a powerful, general-purpose tool for working with Big Data. Spark transparently handles the distribution of computing tasks across a cluster. This means that operations are fast, but it also allows you to focus on the analysis rather than worry about technical details. In this projectget data into Spark and then delve into the three fundamental Spark Machine Learning algorithms: 
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression/Classifiers
- creating pipelines.
  
### Dataset
The flights dataset is a collection of records containing information about flights. It includes features such as the flight carrier,, org, mile, depart, duration,delay, and more. The dataset is stored in a CSV file named flights.csv.
